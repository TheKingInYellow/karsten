\chapter{Web sites}
\label{chap:websites}

Here are a few web sites that you may find useful.  Note that these
links are all ``click-able'' from a PDF file because they were entered with
the ``\verb|\url{...}|'' command.  There is also the
``\verb|\href{mylink}{mytext}|'' command, which creates a link to
\verb|mylink|, but puts the \verb|mytext| as the visible text in your
document.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \url{http://www.google.com}.  (Duh.)
    \item \TeX{}live: \url{http://tug.org/texlive/}.
	One of the free \TeX\ systems, and maybe the best.
    \item Citations Site: \url{http://merkel.zoneo.net/Latex/natbib.php}.
    \item CTAN (the Comprehensive \TeX\ Archive Network):
	\url{http://www.ctan.org/}.  This site contains most
	freely-available \TeX\ resources (including \LaTeX\ itself and
	many contributed packages).
    \item A FAQ: \url{http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html}.
    \item MiKTeX: \url{http://www.miktex.org/}.
    \item Many Tikz and PGF graphics examples:
	\url{http://www.texample.net/}.
	If you want to use PGF/TikZ, this is a good place to look for
	a plot, picture, graph or diagram similar to the one you want.
	You can peruse the output images and then download the
	corresponding source code.
    \item Some symbols: \url{http://www.agu.org/symbols.html}.
